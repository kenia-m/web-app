    <h3>Cultural Insight</h3>
    <p>Santiago Casandeje is a rural town in central Mexico, about a three-hour drive from Mexico City. Home primarily to indigenous Mazahua families, it has around 5,000 residents. Many children in the area do not receive toys during the holidays.</p>
    <p>One of Mexico’s most special traditions is <em>Día de los Reyes Magos</em> (Three Kings Day), which commemorates the gifts brought to the newborn Jesus. Our mission is to ensure every child in Santiago Casandeje enjoys fresh <em>Rosca de Reyes</em> (sweet bread) and the joy of receiving a new toy on this special day.</p>

    </p>
    <p> In memory of Juana Hernandez Montiel, also known as Mamane, this space honors her story and legacy.</p>

    <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-10 items-center">
      <!-- Text (Left side) -->
      <div>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Mamane</h3>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            
          Mamane’s life began with hardship. Her mother died during childbirth, leaving her father to raise her alone. As an Indigenous man in the early 1900s, he supported them by selling handmade wooden chairs and woven rugs (petates). At times, he traveled for a week at a time to Michoacán—sometimes by train, other times on foot—to sell his work. With no choice, he often left young Mamane at home to care for herself as early as the age of five. Since refrigerators did not exist, he stored food in a basket hung high above the ground to keep insects and animals away. She would climb on a chair to reach it and she learned to ration the food carefully to last for the entire week.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          Mamane never attended school, as education for girls was uncommon and her days were filled with endless household responsibilities, specially living in a one parent household. Yet she was remarkably intelligent, fluent in both Mazahua and Spanish. During her adolescence, she worked grinding maize by hand to make tortillas—a staple food in her community. Neighbors often hired her to grind their maize using a traditional stone tool called a <em>metate</em>. This process was labor-intensive but completely organic: maize had to be harvested, boiled with home-made baking soda (cal), and then ground into dough. She was often seen around the village with gorgeous black long braids tied with bright, colorful ribbons.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          As she grew older, Mamane married and raised five daughters. Like her father, she continued selling her own goods, walking miles to neighboring towns while carrying everything on her back in a <em>chiquihuite</em> (a woven basket supported by her forehead). These trips often stretched 10 kilometers each way.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700">
          Mamane’s bold spirit defined her. Once, when a skunk invaded her chicken coop in the middle of the night, she confronted it with her bare hands and, although it was a stinky fight, she won. She returned to her husband, who was asleep, and asked him to turn on the hot water so she could take a bath and rinse off. Another time, when mice tried to invade her home, she waited patiently for hours in the dark, then caught them with her sharp hands. Though denied formal education, Mamane carried immense wisdom and work ethic. She continues to be an inspiration for all the women in my family.
